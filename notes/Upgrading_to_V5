Upgrading to V5 from e2guardian v4

V5 introduces a completely new model for definition and handling of lists, 
logic flow and support for two new modes - transparent(HTTP & HTTPS) and ICAP.

There are changes to the configuration files, mainly in list definition, 
but also some other options have been replaced by storyboard options.

The e2guardian.conf is still used for global settings and 
e2guardianfn.conf for settings specific to group 'n'.  

Both these files contain revised list definitions.  For comptability with
older versions the same list names and paths are retained, so you do
not need to alter your list file structure, unless you want to take
advantage of the new siteiplists.  Details of revised list definition syntax 
is are in notes/V5_list_definition.pdf

A number of settings have been moved into new Storyboard config files. 
These are noted in the example e2guardian.conf and e2guardianf1.conf files.

For details on Storyboard sytax see notes/V5_Storyboard.pd

Storyboard config files are:-

common.story - a library of storyboard functions - you will not need 
to change this file, but you may need to refer to it if you need to 
make more complex changes to the logic flow.  This provides a logic 
functionality as near as possible to v4 built-in logic.

pre-auth.story - actions to be taken before user is put into a filter
group.  You may need to edit this.

site.story - deployment modification of Storyboard library - you may
need to edit this.

fn.story - one per filtergroup - an examplef1.story is provided - you 
will need to edit this.
