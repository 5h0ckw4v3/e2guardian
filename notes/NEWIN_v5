This is the v5 development version (v5.0).  

Note that large sections of the code are being re-written and there are
significant changes to the configuration files in this releases.

Note: This version is work in progress and instructions 
may be incomplete.   If in doubt - read the source!

The v5 is written in c++11 and so to compile it you will need gcc v5.4 
or later. (or another complier that supports the c++11 std::thread library).  
Note that the target systems may also need an c++11 library update.

See notes/NEWIN_v4 for details of the major process model changes 
incorporated from this version.

REVISED LIST and STORYBOARDING MODEL

This version has a completely revised model for defining and using lists.

List definition is now separated from list application. These are no longer 
hard-coded, but mapped to a function using a storyboard.  

Filtering logic flow is simplified and made more consistent.  Requests are 
analysed first and flags set (exception, grey, blocked etc) and once this 
checking is complete actions are taken.  Large sections of duplicate logic
has been removed from ConnectionHandler.

Storyboarding is a simple scripting language that maps lists to function 
and allows flags to be set. 

This means that new lists can be added without changing the code, by adding
a new list definition and then applying it in a revised storyboard.  

A different storyboard can be applied to each filtergroup, so if required, 
each filtergroup can have a different logic flow.
