This is the v5 development version (v5.0).  

Note that large sections of the code has been re-written and there are
significant changes to the configuration files in this release.

The v5 is written in c++11 and so to compile it you will need gcc v5.4 
or later. (or another complier that supports the full c++11).  
Note that the target systems may also need an c++11 library update.

See notes/NEWIN_v4 for details of the major process model changes 
incorporated from version 4.

REVISED LIST and STORYBOARDING MODEL

This version has a completely revised model for defining and using lists.

List definition is now separated from list application. Lists are no longer
hard-coded, but mapped to a function using a storyboard.  

Filtering logic flow is simplified and made more consistent.  Requests are 
analysed first and flags set (exception, grey, blocked etc) and once this 
checking is complete actions are taken.  Large sections of duplicate logic
has been removed from ConnectionHandler and large sections are now
separate functions.

Storyboarding is a simple scripting language that maps lists to functions
and allows flags to be set. 

This means that new lists can be added without changing the code, by adding
a new list definition and then applying it in a revised storyboard.  

A different storyboard can be applied to each filtergroup, so if required, 
each filtergroup can have a different logic flow.

Please read notes/V5_list_definition.pdf & notes/V5_Storyboard.pdf for
details.

TRANSPARENT HTTPS

    This is now in testable form. 
    Detects SNI and flags whether traffic is TLS.  
    Currently limited to port 443 traffic.

ICAP SERVER

    This is now in testable form - REQMOD and RESPMOD mode supported.
    See notes/icap.

DIRECT UPSTREAM ACCESS I.e. not via proxy.  

    This is now in testable form.  

    To implement globaly comment out 'proxyip =' in e2guardian.conf.

    The storyboard action setgodirect can be used within checkrequest functions 
    to enable selected protocols/site/urls to godirect.
    e.g. to send all connect requests directly add
		if(connect) setgodirect
	to a requestchecks function.

STORYBOARD TRACING

    New option 'storyboardtrace' to enable tracing output -
    for storyboard bug-fixing

READABLE THREAD_ID FOR LOGS & DEBUG

    Most debug and syslog messages are now prefixed with a thread ID as
    follows:- 

    master: for master thread

    listen1_proxy:  normal proxy listener
    listen1_thttps: tranparent https listener
    listen1_icap: icap listener

    where '1' is index

    hw10: for http_worker threads where '10' is the thread number

    log: for logging thread

REVISED DEBUG STAGE 1

    The following low level debugs are no longer enabled by DGDEBUG:

    Network sockets - use NETDEBUG instead

    Regular expressions - use REDEBUG instead

    This reduces the volume of information and makes the debug
    log easier to read.

HTTP/1.1

    Support for HTTP v1.1 completed - Chunked encoding now testable

ANTI-VIRUS PLUGINS

    Anti-virus plugins implimented for proxy, trans and ICAP - but individual
    plug-ins not tested

INCLUDE FILES IN e2guardianf1.conf

    Filtergroup configuration files may now include other files, enabling 
    a more DRY approach to configuration. So configuration common to several
    filtergroups can be placed in a file which is included in the filtergroup 
    config file.  Note that where single options and list defines with the same
    Syntax is same as list includes  -
    .include<full_path_to_file>

    Where single options and list defines with the same name are 
    repeated only the last one read will be actioned.  This differs 
    from previous versions where the first single option was actioned and any 
    repeats ignored.  This allows the overwriting of single options and 
    re-definion of lists in a structured way.

LIST INPUT VIA STDIN
--------------------

This replaces the totalblocklist in previous versions allowing multiple
lists to be loaded via stdin.  See notes/lists_via_stdin.
