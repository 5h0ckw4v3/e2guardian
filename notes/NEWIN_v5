This is the v5 development version (v5.0).  

Note that large sections of the code are being re-written and there are
significant changes to the configuration files in this releases.

Note: This version is work in progress and instructions 
may be incomplete.   If in doubt - read the source!

The v5 is written in c++11 and so to compile it you will need gcc v5.4 
or later. (or another complier that supports the c++11 std::thread library).  
Note that the target systems may also need an c++11 library update.

See notes/NEWIN_v4 for details of the major process model changes 
incorporated from version 4.

REVISED LIST and STORYBOARDING MODEL

This version has a completely revised model for defining and using lists.

List definition is now separated from list application. Lists are no longer
hard-coded, but mapped to a function using a storyboard.  

Filtering logic flow is simplified and made more consistent.  Requests are 
analysed first and flags set (exception, grey, blocked etc) and once this 
checking is complete actions are taken.  Large sections of duplicate logic
has been removed from ConnectionHandler and large sections are now
separate functions.

Storyboarding is a simple scripting language that maps lists to functions
and allows flags to be set. 

This means that new lists can be added without changing the code, by adding
a new list definition and then applying it in a revised storyboard.  

A different storyboard can be applied to each filtergroup, so if required, 
each filtergroup can have a different logic flow.

Please read notes/V5_list_definition.pdf & notes/V5_Storyboard.pdf for
details.

TRANSPARENT HTTPS

This is now in testable form. 
Detects SNI and flags whether traffic is TLS.  
Currently limited to port 443 traffic.

ICAP SERVER

This is now in testable form - both REQMOD and RESPMOD.
See notes/icap.

DIRECT ACCESS I.e. not via proxy.  

This is now in testable form.  

To implement globaly comment out 'proxyip =' in e2guardian.conf.

The storyboard action setgodirect can be used within checkrequest functions 
to enable selected protocols/site/urls to godirect.
e.g. to send all connect requests directly add
		if(connect) setgodirect
	to a requestchecks function.

STORYBOARD TRACING

New option 'storyboardtrace' to enable tracing output -
for storyboard bug-fixing

READABLE THREAD_ID FOR LOGS & DEBUG

Id's are:

master: for master thread

listen1_proxy:  normal proxy listener
listen1_thttps: tranparent https listener
listen1_icap: icap listener

where '1' is index

hw10: for http_worker threads where '10' is the thread number

log: for logging thread

HTTP/1.1

First stage in supporting HTTP v1.1 completed - Chunked encoding now testable


TESTING -  

This version is at a test stage. 

TODO - for this release.

ICAP - correct logging

POST filtering

Content chunking for proxyed/thttp traffic - i.e. HTTP/1.1

Enable download/anti-virus plugins

By-pass code

Transparent HTTPS on ports other than 443

Re-look at MITM certificate generation.

Final tidy code, error messages.
