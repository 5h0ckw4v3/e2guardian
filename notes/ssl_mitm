The SSL MITM option allows https sites to be content checked.

The request from the client is intercepted, a spoofed certificate supplied for 
the target site and an encrypted connection made back to the client.  
A separate encrypted connection to the target server is set up.  The resulting 
http dencrypted stream is then filtered as normal.

Sites in the exception lists are treated in the same way as before 
(i.e. NOT unencrypted) so sites dealing with sensistive information that should
not be intercepted (e.g. bank finance, account logins, etc) and other sites 
deemed 'safe' can be made exempt from being examined.

Advantages are that the user gets a proper block page and full https urls are 
logged, https urls can be whitelisted when site as a whole is banned and content
can be content checked.

Disavantages are that in order for MITM to be usable a private root CA 
certificate has to be installed on each browser and that more processing power 
is needed on the server in order to encrypt and unencrypt the traffic.

To set up MITM:

   Configure and compile e2guardian with the --enable-sslmitm flag set

   Generate your certicates and keys:-


   Assign key paths in e2guardian.conf:-

   Set  sllmitm = yes in e2guardianf1.conf

   Load user.der certificate on each browser.
